# Demo Walkthrough - Sprint 2 (Updated)

## 🚀 Overview
This demo showcases the successful completion of Sprint 2, focusing on the "Initial Dummy Setup". This milestone validates the multi-agent workflow, parallel execution, and the project's foundational infrastructure.

## 📦 What was Built
### 1. Backend Infrastructure (Mock)
- **Component:** `project_tracking/dummy_api.py`
- **Purpose:** Establishes the pattern for Backend agents. It provides a simple status endpoint.
- **Functionality:** Returns `"OK"` to signal system health.

### 2. Frontend State Tracking (Mock)
- **Component:** `project_tracking/dummy_ui.txt`
- **Purpose:** Defines the initial state tracking for the UI, serving as a placeholder for the upcoming React implementation.
- **Functionality:** Displays `"UI Loaded"`.

### 3. Parallel Multi-Agent Workflow
- **Achievement:** Successfully demonstrated the Orchestrator's ability to coordinate parallel tasks between specialized agents and merge their contributions into the shared `project_tracking` state.

## 🛠️ How to Use/Verify
Follow these steps to verify the current build:

### Backend Verification
Execute the dummy API script:
```bash
python project_tracking/dummy_api.py
```
**Expected Output:** `OK`

### Frontend Verification
View the placeholder UI state:
```bash
# On Unix-like systems:
cat project_tracking/dummy_ui.txt

# On Windows:
type project_tracking\dummy_ui.txt
```
**Expected Output:** `UI Loaded`

## ✅ Quality Assurance Status
- **Status:** **ALL PASSED** ✅
- **Evidence:** As documented in `project_tracking/QA_REPORT.md`:
    - **Dummy API Verification:** PASSED (Output: `OK`)
    - **Dummy UI Verification:** PASSED (Content: `UI Loaded`)
- **Process Improvement:** The previous gap regarding the QA report has been closed; `QA_REPORT.md` is now a standard part of the sprint artifacts.

## 📊 Sprint Context
- **Sprint Goal:** Validate the full sprint lifecycle.
- **Status:** [x] Done
- **Next Steps:** Transition to real framework boilerplate (FastAPI/React) and begin Sprint 3.
